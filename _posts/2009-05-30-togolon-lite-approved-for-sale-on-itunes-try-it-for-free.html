<p><img width="150" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="150" align="right" src="/assets/TogolonLiteIcon.png" alt="" />Well, after much fiddling and twiddling with level designs, the Lite version of my iPhone game, Togolon is now available for download in the iTunes App Store. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=317125582&amp;mt=8">Click here to download</a>.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Lite version features 6 sample levels, and all the gameplay elements of the full game, and all for the low, low price of FREE.</p>
<p>Togolon is a bit like a cross between Labyrinth and Light Out:&nbsp;roll your ball around the maze to turn all the red tiles green - but be quick, you don't have long! Try to beat your top scores and level times, and if you get a call, or need a break, just pick up where you left off last time.</p>
<p>So, fire up those iPhones and iPods and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=317125582&amp;mt=8">give it a try</a>!<br />
Still not convinced?&nbsp;Check out my little <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn1sBvvcexQ">promo video</a> on Youtube.</p>
<p>I'm hard at work on version 1.1 of Togolon, and I'm really keen for some feedback to make it even better, so please feel free to pop a review on iTunes, even if you didn't like the game.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
