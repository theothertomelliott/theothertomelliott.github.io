After a quick shakedown at a Toastmasters meeting last night - huge thanks to [Humorous Toastmasters](https://www.facebook.com/HumorousToastmasters) - I submitted Speaker Alert 2.0.1 to the App Store this morning. This afternoon, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the update had been reviewed and approved in record time!

Version 2.0.1 adds:

* Fixes for adding new profiles, which was causing crashes in some cases.
* The idle timer is now disabled during speeches, so your screen won't dim or lock
* Demo mode (accessible from the settings screen) 

Speaker Alert 2.0.1 is 100% free and available today for iOS 8 and higher.
