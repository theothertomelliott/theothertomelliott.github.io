<p><strong>Another British 10k has come and gone, and nearly a week later, it's probably time I updated you all on how it went!</strong></p>
<p>Ok, so it wasn't my best year, and after a rather unfortunate stitch at the 7k mark, my final time was 1 hour and 2 minutes. Four minutes down on previous years, but it's still respectable. Plus it was a lot of fun! If you ignore the kilometer of side pain.</p>
<p>Over 25,000 people ran the race this year, and I was treated to such sights as Scooby Doo running on two lets, a Darth Vader/Stormtrooper duo, and no less than three people puking within 100m of the finish. Special mention to the determined guy who adopted a puke-run-puke-run strategy.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I've been able to raise nearly £250 so far for Epilepsy Research, hot on the heels of last year's total! A huge thanks to everyone who's sponsored me so far, and to anyone who didn't get round to it, there's still time!</p>
<p>Check out my <a title="Tom's Third 10k - Sponsorship" href="http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/TomElliott">Virgin Money Giving page</a> for the current total and to make your donation.</p>
