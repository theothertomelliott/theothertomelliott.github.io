<p><strong>Just a couple of weeks after the initial <a href="http://www.theothertomelliott.com/node/711">weekend's work</a> on Speaker Alert, it's been approved for sale (I say sale, it's free) on the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/speaker-alert/id488585337?ls=1&amp;mt=8">iTunes App Store</a>! </strong></p>
<p>The first big test of Speaker Alert at the <a href="http://phoenixspeakers.co.uk/">Phoenix Speakers</a> XMas party went off without a hitch, a whole bunch of table topics were timed, and nobody went over their allotted minute and a half. So on Sunday, I snatched a couple of hours to put together some icon artwork and promotional blurb, and submitted a build to Apple.</p>
<p>Impressively, just four days later, I got an e-mail telling me Speaker Alert had been approved. Although I imagine that with it being such a simple app, there wasn't a whole lot for them to test.</p>
<p>So there we go. One full weekend, plus a couple of hours <a href="http://www.theothertomelliott.com/node/746">here and there</a> for polish, and that little project's complete. On to the next!</p>
<p>Download Speaker Alert from the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/speaker-alert/id488585337?ls=1&amp;mt=8">App Store</a>.<br />
