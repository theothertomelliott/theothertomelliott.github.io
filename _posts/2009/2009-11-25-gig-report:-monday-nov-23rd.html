<p><strong><img width="200" height="266" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="right" alt="" src="/assets/catc.jpg" />A second outing for Ian From Human Resources at Monday's <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=120669617850">Comedy at the College</a>. A great night had by all, and a chance to polish material a little in a different setting.</strong></p>
<p>After a few weeks with only my regular 5 Minutes of Fame gig, I was getting a little itchy to go to some other nights, so I booked into CATC - a new, conveniently central night run by some friends of mine. The room had a nice, intimate feel, and although the audience was mainly other acts, everyone was really supportive (most of us knew each other from the open circuit) and it made for a really nice atmosphere.</p>
<p>In general, my material went down pretty well (had some really nice comments and a later act even referenced my list of deviant sex acts in his set), although different parts got the bigger laughs this time. So one thing I definitely need to work on is pausing for laughs where they come, and not waiting for any that aren't happening. A couple of times I continued talking over laughs, which is a major no-no.</p>
<p>All in all, though, a great night, and I'm looking forward to Ian's next outing at this week's 5 Minutes of Fame!</p>
