No more juggling your phone and a paper notepad during a meeting! Speaker Alert now includes a "History" tab so you can keep track of everyone's time.

![The new history tab in action]({{ site.github.url | replace:'http://','//' }}/media/speaker-alert-250-track-times-with-the-new-history-tab/screenshot.png){: .aligncenter}

After a speech, set a short description to help you remember who was speaking, and during your timer's report, you just need to read the list for that day.

Not only that, but we've also fixed a few issues with the watch app, so you can control the timer from your wrist more easily.

Happy Speaking!
