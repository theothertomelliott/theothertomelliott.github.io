<p><strong><img width="150" height="150" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="right" alt="" src="/assets/togolonLogo.jpg" />Work is powering ahead on the next version of Togolon, and I've got some really great new features lined up. So I'm after a few people to help me beta test the new version to make sure it's stable, fast and as easy to use as possible.</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps the most common comment I've had about Togolon 1.0 and 1.0.1 is the lack of a global scoreboard. Well, I've been playing with the <a href="http://www.scoreloop.com/">ScoreLoop</a> API lately, and not only can it give Togolon a global scoreboard, but it also offers challenges and a raft of social features.</p>
<p><strong>What Am I Looking For?</strong></p>
<p>I'm after about 10 people to try out the new version of Togolon for about a week or so. If you have an iPhone or an iPod Touch, and a sense of fun, you're already more than qualified.</p>
<p><strong><img width="200" height="305" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="left" alt="" src="/assets/Picture 1.png" />What Would A Tester Do?</strong></p>
<p>Play Togolon! Then tell me about any crashes, quirks, or niggles. If anything breaks, make a note of where and when you saw it, and drop me an e-mail. Something not make sense or just not feel right? Let me know.</p>
<p>I'm not going to give a big formal list of stuff to test, but 10 heads are better than one for this sort of thing. And someone else might play the game totaly differently to me, and uncover a crash that might have frustrated a whole load of people.</p>
<p>Not only that, but you can be first to get your top score online for everyone to see!</p>
<p><strong>Then What?</strong></p>
<p>When we're all done, and the final build of version 1.1 is submitted, I'll send you all a finished copy of the full game for free. And if you've given me some useful comments or ideas, I'll be sure to post my thanks to the Togolon iTunes page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you're interested, drop me an e-mail: <a href="mailto:tom.w.elliott@gmail.com?subject=Togolon%201.1%20Beta%20Test">tom.w.elliott@gmail.com</a> and I'll get you set up.</p>
